# Capybara BBC Login - Automated Testing

For this homework I was required to test the **BBC Login and Registration** functionality using Capybara.  I built a full POM for services and also included 10 minute email to grab a fresh email to sign up with.  The tests run were to test that all data input had been what was input as well as testing to see if error messages were displayed when inputting incorrect login details.

# Tests Run

- Full user journey of signing into the BBC website
- Full user journey of a successful registration
- Attempting to log in to the site with invalid credentials

# To Run The Tests

- Clone the repo using `git clone git@github.com:NBurns90/sparta-capybara-bbc.git`
- Open the file space in **Atom**
- Run `gem install capybara`
- Run `gem install selenium`
- To perform the tests type `rspec` in terminal
